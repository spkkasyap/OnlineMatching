# OnlineMatching
Input: Number of nodes in graph(the sum of number of nodes in the sets S and R)

#To run the code
Run the class Driver.class as follows:
java Driver 100 (say 100 is the total number of nodes resulting in a 50 x 50 bipartite graph)

#Understanding the output
The output will have the multiple lines, where each line has the following header:
(let c.r be the competitive ratio, t be the constant)
num of nodes, c.r for t=1, c.r for t=3, c.r for t=5, c.r for t=10, c.r for t=100, c.r for t=1000, 
c.r for t=10000, c.r for t=100000, c.r for t=1000000
